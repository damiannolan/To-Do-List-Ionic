To Do List App
=====================

# to-do-app

The purpose of this app is to maintain a simple To Do List of tasks such as getting grocerys or cleaning the house for example.

I have tried my best to make it as easy and simple to use as possible. I used the ionic sidemenu template as a base for starting my project.

When launched the app's default view is on the main To-Do list page. It also contains a Completed items page and About Me page.
To add items to the To Do List, a user can simply press the + button on the header bar at the top right of the view.
To add a To Do List item to the Completed Items list, the user can simple press the checkmark icons on any of the List items.
Both the To Do List and Completed Items lists contain a toggle for permanently removing list items.

All of the user's list information for both lists is saved using Local Storage.
